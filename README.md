HTML/CSS first, accessible and progressively enhanced login page and homepage header that indicates login status.

## Instructions

## Benefits

- Mobile first approach
- Design system concept - coded with config, theme, layout and component structure
- Latest ECMAScript 2023 features such as module based JS
- php docker for easy simple install
- Ajax integration for web components
- NPM setup and usuage (for prettier) without impacting production files and breaking exercise requirements.
- Latest CSS features e.g. Native nested CSS, layout props, css vars
- Frontend validation for instant feedback. Fallback to backend validation
- Variable/config based CSS
- Graceful degradation for older browsers.

## Out of scope

If I had longer than a hour I would like to add:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) unit testing
- Storybook to document design system elements
- Pollyfill for older browsers e.g. nested CSS
- Typescript
- Single page behaviour but with Graceful degradation for older browsers

My other examples of frontend work with graceful degradation

- o2 website with heavy animation and effects. But will degrade to simple html bullet list for search engine optimisation and older devices: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvthDObDm7U&t=12s&ab_channel=londonbrawler

- Hear Colours: http://hearcolours.com/site/ behaves like popular single page frameworks (e.g. React). Animations, integrated scrollbars which all still work for Javascript disabled
